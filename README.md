# What is RoCS?
RoCS (Robotics and Cognitive Systems) is a framework to support the software development for autonomous robots. The framework is based on the well-known IBM Autonomic Computing reference architecture (also known as MAPE-K). 

# Why should I use RoCS?

Some important principles what we belive to be advantages of adopting the RoCS framework:
* RoCS intends to be general and multiplatform, forstering reuse across different robot models. 
* RoCS core architecture is simple and use few components that communicate through recognized patterns. 
* RoCS implements the hybrid robotics paradigm, making possible to use deliberative and reactive behaviors.
